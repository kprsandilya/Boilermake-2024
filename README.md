## How To Play

 - The objective of this game is to make as much money as possible from selling harvested crops.
 - In order to grow crops, you first need to till any area with soil in it with the T key. You can till anywhere without cost.
 - You need money to acquire resources such as fertilizers and crop seeds from the shop, which can be accessed by clicking on it.
 - After buying fertilizer, use the F key to fertilize the soil.
 - Buy seeds of your choice and plant them in the fertilizer using any of the first five number keys.
 - Press W to water these seeds. You do not need to buy water.
 - Once the plants grow to their final stage, press H to harvest them for money. However, you need to be quick, as the plants will disappear after a certain time!
 - If you have enough money, you can buy levels of prestige. This will exponentially increase any earnings from harvesting.
 - It will rain at random intervals, halving the amount of time it takes for plants to grow. Stay on your toes!
 - That's it, you're all set to play! Happy harvesting!
